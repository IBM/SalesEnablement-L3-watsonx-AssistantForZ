You should be prepared to fill these wait times with some type of commentary. During these wait periods consider explaining in more detail what is being performed in the background, values of the automation, general values of the offering, or answering questions the client may have. </li> <li>Google Chrome is the recommended browser for this environment. Some users have experienced intermittent errors with running some of the skills when using other browsers.</li> <li>Run all prerequisites steps before starting the demonstration. Prerequisite steps are described with each scenario.</li> <li>Anticipate different responses from the scripted queries. The ITZ environment is a live and changing demonstration environment. Responses are subject to change as updates are made to the large language model (LLM) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) used by IBM watsonx Assistant for Z.</li> <li>Follow the scripts in the IBM watsonx Assistant for Z for Technical Sales Level 3 Demonstration Guide for the automations and skills to run as expected. </li> <li> <p>When issuing other prompts:</p> <ul> <li>Procedural questions provide better structure to responses. For example, in a query it is better to use \"Explain how to estimate space requirements for Db2 table spaces without using Db2 admin tool. Provide a step-by-step answer.\u201d versus \"How to estimate space requirements for table spaces?\"</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>When asking a generic question, responses are more accurate when possessive adjectives are avoided.

IBM watsonx Assistant for Z understands over 200 IBM Z products and is designed to enable clients to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Expedite the onboarding process, quickly enhancing platform expertise of early tenure professionals with a side-by-side AI assistant, accelerating their journey to productivity with confidence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improve productivity, autonomy, and confidence across all skill levels, by offering a central place to find answers and running automation to perform common and complex tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p>And you can also leverage the platform to ingest your own documentation further benefiting from this solution. I won't be covering this capability today, but as we move forward we can show how easy this is done, along with adding other skills using your own automation through Ansible, REXX, and JCL.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this demo, we will run through a couple of scenarios that highlight the value IBM watsonx Assistant for Z can provide to various roles in your organization regardless of skill level. These scenarios also leverage skills using Ansible Automation to provide great flexibility when it comes to automating Z-specific tasks as part of your enterprise automation strategy. </p> <p>Let's get started.</p> <p>Other Speaker's scripts are included in some scenarios for some prompts. This sample client demonstration video also provides additional talking points for the Db2 and certificate renewal scenarios.</p> <p>When you plan your demonstration, choose the scenarios that best fit your client's requirements.</p>"},{"location":"scenarios/db2Versioning/","title":"Scenario 3: Db2 versioning","text":""},{"location":"scenarios/db2Versioning/#scenario-db2-versioning","title":"Scenario: Db2 versioning","text":""},{"location":"scenarios/db2Versioning/#scenario-overview","title":"Scenario overview","text":"<p>Speaker's script</p> <p>You are now a new database administrator (DBA) and need to quickly familiarize yourself with the Db2 subsystem in your company's IBM Z environment.

Most early-tenure DBAs don't have this experience. You leverage the virtual assistant that is customized with pre-existing automation your team has in place. And by leveraging the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) grounded on IBM Z-specific knowledge, you have confidence that the responses generated from the questions are accurate. You like the fact that you can go to one place to get answers to any question, on-demand, and can help automate some of the tasks, which in turn reduces your learning curve and increases your efficiency.</p> <p>Responses from the virtual assistant are likely to change</p> <p>Responses generated by IBM watsonx Assistant for Z are likely to change over time.
