# Demonstration guidance
Whether for a client, a session at a conference, or performing your Stand and Deliver, preparation for a demonstration is critical. Included are both general demonstration guidance and helpful tips for using {{offering.name}} and the IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment that is associated with the {{learningplan.name}} learning plan.

## General demonstration guidance
Knowing the audience that you are presenting to is critical. Having a basic understanding of a client's business and their challenges enables you to customize the conversation so it resonates with the audience. It is also important to understand the roles of the individuals in the audience to know the at what level of technical detail to present.

In addition, it is always a good idea to:

- Know how much time is allotted for the demonstration.
- Anticipate what questions that the audience will ask.
- Anticipate what objections that the audience may raise.
- Have a backup plan like a video recording of the demonstration for events like network failures and unexpected errors.
- If the demonstration is to be delivered virtually, make sure everything works using the e-meeting technology.
- Do not deviate from the demonstration script. Straying from the planned a demonstration can lead to unexpected results and failure.
- If possible, and time permits, make the demonstration interactive. If that isn't possible, be sure to leave time for questions.
- Always conclude with a **call to action** (for example, next steps, follow-on activities, and so on).

And, most importantly, practice, practice, and practice.

## Specific guidance for {{offering.name}} and the ITZ environment
Following the scripts that are provided in the {{guide.name}} helps assure a successful demonstration. Use these tips to help assure success with {{offering.name}} and the ITZ environment:

- Google Chrome is the recommended browser for this environment. Some users have experienced intermittent errors with running some of the skills when using other browsers.
- Run all prerequisites steps before the presentation. Prerequisite steps are described with each demonstration scenario.
- Anticipate different responses from the scripted queries. The ITZ environment is a live and changing demonstration environment. Responses are subject to change as updates are made to the large language model (LLM) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) used by {{offering.name}}.
- Follow the scripts in the {{guide.name}} for the automations and skills to run as expected. 
- When issuing other prompts:
  - Procedural questions provide better structure to responses. For example, in a query it is better to use "Explain how to estimate space requirements for Db2 table spaces without using Db2 admin tool. Provide a step-by-step answer.” versus "how to estimate space requirements for table spaces."
  - When asking a generic question, responses are more accurate when possessive adjectives are avoided. For instance, "How do I check the Db2 for z/OS version on a logical partition (LPAR)?” versus "How do I check *my* Db2 for z/OS version on *my* LPAR?”
  - Compound questions perform better. As an example, “Categorize the various zparms available.” versus “What is zparm?”
  - Question styles like pros and cons and *A* versus *B* work better. For instance, “What are the pros and cons for setting GMTRAN to EXIT? Provide a detailed answer.”

If you know your client and the client's environment well, client-specific questions add value to the demonstration. However, it is critical to validate the accuracy of the responses before attempting in a live demonstration.

Next, explore the scripted demonstrations that are created by {{offering.name}} experts.
