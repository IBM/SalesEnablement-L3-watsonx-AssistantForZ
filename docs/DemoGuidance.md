Wether for a client, a session at a conference, or, if you are an IBM technical seller, your Stand and Deliver, preparation for a demonstration is critical. Included below are both general demonstration guidance and helpful tips for using {{offering.name}} and the IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) environment associated with the {{learningplan.name}} learning plan.

## General demonstration guidance
Knowing the audience you are presenting to is critical. Having at least a basic understanding of a client's business and their challenges enables you to customize your conversation so it hits home with the audience. In addition, it is important to understand the roles of the individuals in your audience to know at what level of technical detail you should present.

In addition, it is always a good idea to:

- Know how much time is allotted for the demonstration.
- Anticipate what questions the audience will ask.
- Anticipate what objections the audience may raise.
- Have a backup plan like a video recording of the demonstration in case of events like network failures, unexpected errors, etc.
- If the demonstration is to be delivered virtually, make sure everything works as planned using the e-meeting technology that will be used.
- Try not to deviate from your script unless the client forces you in a different direction. Adlibbing during a demonstration can lead to unexpected results and failure.
- If possible, and time permits, make the demonstration interactive. If that isn't possible, be sure to leave time for questions.
- Always conclude with a **call to action**, for example, next steps, follow-on activities, etc.

And, most importantly, practice, practice, and practice.

## Specific guidance for {{offering.name}} and the ITZ environment
Following the scripts provided in the {{guide.name}} will help guarantee a successful demonstration. Use these tips to help insure success with {{offering.name}} and the ITZ environment:

- Follow the scripts in the {{guide.name}} for the automations amd skills to execute as expected.
- Perform any pre-requisites steps prior to presenting. These are described with each demonstration scenario.
- Anticipate different responses from the scripted queries. This is a live and changing demonstration environment. Responses are subject to change as updates are made to the large language model (LLM) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) used by {{offering.name}}.
- Procedural questions provide better structure to responses. For example, in a query it is better to use "Please explain how to estimate space requirements for Db2 table spaces without using db2 admin tool. Provide a step-by-step answer.” versus "how to estimate space requirements for tablespaces."
- When asking a generic question, responses are usually more accurate when possessive adjectives are avoided. For instance, "How do I check the Db2 for z/OS version on an logical partition (LPAR)?” versus "How do I check *my* Db2 for z/OS version on *my* LPAR?”
- Compound questions perform better. As an example, “Categorize the various zparms available.” versus “What is zparm?”
- Question styles like pros and cons and *A* versus *B* work better. For instance, “What are the pros and cons for setting GMTRAN to EXIT? Please provide a detailed answer.”

If you know your client and the client's environment well, customer specific questions will add value to the demonstration. However, it is critical to validate the accuracy of the responses before doing so in front of the client.
