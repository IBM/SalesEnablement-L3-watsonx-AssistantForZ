This {{learningplan.name}} demonstrated several of the {{offering.name}} capabilities. However, there is still more to learn about {{offering.name}}. Be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-assistant-for-z?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=Watsonx%20assistant%20for%20z" target="_blank">offering landing page</a> and the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/waz/2.0" target="_blank">product documentation</a>. 

Also, the focus of the {{guide.name}} was the *end-user* use of {{offering.name}}.

Included are guidance for running client pilots and the ability to manage an {{offering.name}} deployment. In the Velocity Pilot environment, you can explore all the capabilities of the offering like creating an assistant, importing documents, and adding automation skills.
