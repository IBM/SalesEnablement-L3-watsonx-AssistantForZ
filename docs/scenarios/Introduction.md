# Scenarios
This section includes expert-created a set of scenarios that illustrate the domain-specific knowledge of {{offering.name}}. Each scenario includes step-by-step guidance based on actual client interactions and workflows with IBM Z. Each scenario provides:

- A brief overview of the scenario.
- Any prerequisite or setup steps necessary for the scenario to work in the demonstration environment.
- A list of queries and Example output that illustrate the scenario.
- Any cleanup steps that must be run after the scenario.

!!! Warning "Responses from the virtual assistant are likely to change"

    Responses generated by {{offering.name}} are likely to change over time. The responses you see when you run through the scenarios may differ from the screen images captured in this guide. Using the exact queries specified will help assure a successful demonstration.

Each scenario overview is written as if they are being presented to a client versus the typical prose of the demonstration guide. The **Speaker's script** illustrates the style and how to start a client demonstration.

!!! Quote "Speaker's script"

    Hello **[insert customer name]**. Welcome to this demonstration of {{offering.name}}. Today, many early tenure IBM Z administrators spend hours looking for current information, accurate information, and performing time-consuming manual tasks. And they are very dependent on the Subject Matter Experts to complete their tasks.

    {{offering.name}} is a new generative AI assistant that melds automation with conversational AI to help transform how system programmers, operators, and developers of all experience levels engage with and manage their IBM Z. {{offering.name}} understands over 200 IBM Z products and is designed to enable clients to:
    
    - Expedite the onboarding process, quickly enhancing platform expertise of early tenure professionals with a side-by-side AI assistant, accelerating their journey to productivity with confidence.
    
    - Improve productivity, autonomy, and confidence across *all* skill levels, by offering a central place to find answers and running automation to perform common and complex tasks.
  
    - And you can also leverage the platform to ingest your own documentation further benefiting from this solution. I won't be covering this capability today, but as we move forward we can show how easy this is done, along with adding other skills using your own automation through Ansible, REXX, and JCL.

    In this demo, we will run through a couple of scenarios that highlight the value {{offering.name}} can provide to various roles in your organization regardless of skill level. These scenarios also leverage skills using Ansible Automation to provide great flexibility when it comes to automating Z-specific tasks as part of your enterprise automation strategy. 

    Let's get started.

Other Speaker's scripts are included in some scenarios for some prompts. This <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC7b883BQDJqj8TPcPWqHGdcCRq3" target="_blank">sample client demonstration video</a> also provides additional talking points for the Db2 and certificate renewal scenarios.

When you plan your demonstration, choose the scenarios that best fit your client's requirements.
