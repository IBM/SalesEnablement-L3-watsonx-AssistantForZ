In this chapter, find several modules that provide step-by-step guidance for using {{offering.name}} in specific scenarios based upon typical client interactions and workflows with IBM Z. Each scenario provides:

- A brief overview of the scenario.
- Any pre-requisite or setup steps necessary for the scenario to work in the demonstration environment.
- A list of queries and sample output that illustrate the scenario using {{offering.name}}.
- Any cleanup steps that should be performed for the scenario.

!!! warning "Responses from the virtual assistant may change"

    Responses are subject to change as updates are made {{offering.name}} and the large language model (LLM) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) used in the demonstration environment. The responses you see when you run the queries may differ from the screen images captured in the {{guide.name}}.

Each scenario overview is written as if being presented to the client versus the typical prose of the demonstration guide. To illustrate, here is a introduction that may be used to start a client demonstration.

!!! Abstract "Speaker's script"

    Hello *[insert customer name]*, Welcome to this demonstration of {{offering.name}}. Today, many early tenure IBM Z users spend hours looking for current information, accurate information, and performing time-consuming manual tasks. And they are very dependent on the Subject Matter Experts to complete their tasks.

    {{offering.name}} is a new generative AI assistant that infuses automation into conversational AI to help transform how system programmers, operators, and developers of all experience levels engage with and manage the mainframe.
    {{offering.name}} is designed to enable clients to:
    
    - Expedite the onboarding process, quickly enhancing platform expertise of early tenure professionals with a side-by-side AI assistant, accelerating their journey to productivity with confidence.
    
    - Improve productivity, autonomy, and confidence across all skill levels, by offering a central place to find answers and running automation to perform common and complex tasks.
  
    - And you can also leverage the platform to ingest your own documentation further benefiting from the solution.

    In this demo, we will run through a couple of scenarios that highlight the value {{offering.name}} can provide to various roles in your organization regardless of skill level. The scenarios also leverage skills using Ansible Automation to provide great flexibility when it comes to automating Z-specific tasks as part of your enterprise automation strategy.

    Let's get started.

When performing a client demonstration, choose the scenarios that best fit the client's requirements.
