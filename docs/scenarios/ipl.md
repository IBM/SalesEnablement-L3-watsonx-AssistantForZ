# Scenarios: Initial Program Load
## Scenario overview
!!! Quote "Speaker's script"

    You are now a Systems Programmer (sysprog) that is preparing for an upcoming IPL scheduled for one of your IBM Z systems. It’s been a while since you helped prepare for an IPL and we want to refamiliarize yourself with this process. Rather than spending time reading through the wide array of documentation available online, you leverage the conversational AI capabilities provided by IBM watsonx Assistant for Z to get accurate responses to your questions quickly, along with step-by-step guidance and links to documentation to learn more. When asking the assistant “How to perform an IPL on IBM Z?”, we realize there’s some information needed about our system, for example the IPL volume and the IPL LOAD PARM. The conversational skills capabilities provided by the assistant allows you to issue operator commands on the system directly within the assistant itself, serving as a one-stop shop for retrieving details required for the IPL process to go smoothly and increasing efficiency.

!!! Warning "Responses from the virtual assistant are likely to change"

    Responses generated by {{offering.name}} are likely to change over time. The responses you see when you run the queries may differ from the screen images captured in the {{guide.name}}. Using the exact queries specified will help assure a successful demonstration.

## Prerequisites steps
None.

## Prompts and sample outputs
??? Tip "Copy and paste the prompt"

    Use the copy icon (![](_attachments/copyIcon.png)) to copy prompts from the demonstration guide and then paste the prompt into the Assistant using ++ctrl+v++ or right click and select ```Paste```.

    === "Actions"

        A skill is triggered to execute an operator command on the LPAR.
    
        1. Complete the form using these values: 
        
            - **Field 1**: <*Leave the default value.*>
            - **Field 2**: <*Leave the default value.*>
            - **extra-vars.zos_operator_command_survey**: D IPLINFO

        2. Click **Apply**.

            Another form will return showing the corresponding **ID** for the previous job.

        3. Click **Apply**.
   
            Review the output of the command, including **(a)** the last time the system was IPLed, the z/OS version, **(b)** the IPL LOAD PARM (LOADK2 member in SYS0.IPLPARM), and **(c)** the IPL boot volume (D25VS1).
