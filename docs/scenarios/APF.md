# Scenario: Authorized Program Facility
## Scenario overview
!!! Quote "Speaker's script"

    Imagine you are an early-tenure systems programmer (sysprog) that is tasked with updating the Authorized Program Facility (APF) authorized list on an logical partition (LPAR) and would like to quickly find guidance on doing this without having to read a bunch of manuals. In z/OS, the APF list includes information about libraries that contain APF-authorized programs. You would also like to take advantage of some simple automation to complete this task if possible. 
    
    As you will see, in the last prompt, {{offering.name}} will respond with the command to run to add the library to the APF authorized list, followed by prompting you to run a skill (issuing a z/OS console command) on your behalf which will perform the task.

!!! Warning "Responses from the virtual assistant are likely to change"

    Responses generated by {{offering.name}} are likely to change over time. The responses you see when you run the queries in this section may differ from the screen images captured in the {{guide.name}}. Using the exact queries specified will help assure a successful demonstration. Also, as updates to the environment are made, some confirmation dialogs may no longer be displayed as illustrated in the Example outputs.
