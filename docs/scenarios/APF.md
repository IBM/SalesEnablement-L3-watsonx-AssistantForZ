# Scenario: Authorized Program Facility
## Scenario overview
!!! Quote "Speaker's script"

    Imagine you are an early-tenure systems programmer (sysprog) that is tasked with updating the Authorized Program Facility (APF) authorized list on an logical partition (LPAR) and would like to quickly find guidance on doing this without having to read a bunch of manuals. In z/OS, the APF list includes information about libraries that contain APF-authorized programs. You would also like to take advantage of some simple automation to complete this task if possible. 
    
    As you will see, in the last prompt, {{offering.name}} will respond with the command you will need to run to add the library to the APF authorized list, followed by prompting you to run a skill (issuing a z/OS console command) on your behalf which will perform the task.

!!! Warning "Responses from the virtual assistant are likely to change"

    Responses generated by {{offering.name}} are likely to change over time. The responses you see when you run the queries may differ from the screen images captured in the {{guide.name}}. Using the exact queries specified will help assure a successful demonstration.

## Prerequisites steps
None.
## Prompts and sample outputs
!!! Tip "Copy and paste the prompt"

    Use the copy icon ![](../attachments/copyIcon.png) to copy prompts from the demonstration guide and then paste the prompt into the Assistant using ++ctrl+v++ or right click and select ```Paste```.

        Notice the detailed level of the response, and more importantly, notice the expandable section at the bottom of the response. If I expand the section **[expand]** we see the referenced sources that were used to build the answer. This illustrates just part of the explainable AI capabilities of watsonx.

    === "Actions"

        Following the response, you’ll be prompted by the assistant to run the proposed automation on your behalf. 
    
        1. Click **Yes**.
        2. Click **Apply** to run the skill. 
        
            Note, there are no additional parameters to fill in the form, hence the *“Form is empty”* message. It will take about 30 seconds for the command to run.

        3. View the **cmd-response** field to verify the command was successful.
