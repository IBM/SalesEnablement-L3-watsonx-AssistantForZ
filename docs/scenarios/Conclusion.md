# Scenario: Conclusion
As mentioned in the demonstration guidance chapter, it is important to conclude your demonstration with a call to action.

    So that wraps up the demonstration of IBM watsonx Assistant for Z. As you can see, in the case of an early-tenure mainframe system programmer or even a more experienced system programmer, rather than spending hours searching through documentation to find answers, they can leverage the domain specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounded on Z specific knowledge to get trusted answers in seconds. And it also allows them to free up time by automating some of their more manual tasks that they can otherwise spend on building expertise. 

    Thank you for your time today, would you agree to meeting again for a more comprehensive workshop?
