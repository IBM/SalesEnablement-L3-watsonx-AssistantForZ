!!! Warning "Printed or saved copies can be out of date"

    The {{guide.name}} changes regularly to match the {{offering.name}} offering and associated ITZ environment. Printed or saved copies of the demonstration guide can become out-of-date quickly and result in failed steps. 

For the best quality printed output:

- Use Google Chrome. The PDF file that is generated from the Chrome browser prevents images from being printed across page boundaries.
- Save as PDF first, and then print the PDF with Adobe Acrobat. Doing so expands all collapsed sections in the guide (for example the hints on the Welcome page). 
- Deselect the "Headers and footers" option in the print options.

Click the **[Print page]{:target="_blank"}** link and use your browser's **print** capability to save as a PDF and then print the PDF with Adobe Acrobat.
